### Calculation:  
- **Annual Income**: ₹12,00,000.  
- **Affordable Home Budget**: ₹24,00,000 to ₹36,00,000 (2x–3x annual income).  

This ensures you don't overextend yourself financially and still have enough for other priorities (investments, emergencies, and day-to-day expenses).

### Key Considerations Before Buying a Home:  
1. **Hidden Costs**: Factor in registration fees, stamp duty, maintenance charges, and furnishing costs.  
2. **Investment Philosophy**:  
   - Avoid buying real estate too early if it will strain your savings or limit your ability to invest in higher-return assets like stocks.  
3. **Rent vs. Buy Analysis**: Consider renting if property prices are very high compared to rental costs in your city.
