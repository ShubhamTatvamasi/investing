When it comes to buying a home, a common rule of thumb is the **28/36 Rule**. Here's how it works:

---

### **28/36 Rule**:  
1. **28% of Gross Monthly Income**: Your total housing expenses (including mortgage, property taxes, and insurance) should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income.  
2. **36% of Total Debt**: Your total debt payments (housing, car, credit cards, etc.) should not exceed 36% of your gross monthly income.

### If You're Skipping the Loan:  
If you're paying upfront without a loan, the amount you can spend on a home depends on:  
1. **Savings and Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have at least 6–12 months of living expenses set aside as an emergency fund before making such a significant purchase.  
2. **Comfortable Budget**: Financial advisors often recommend not spending more than **2x to 3x your annual income** on a home.

### Example Calculation:  
- **Annual Income**: ₹12,00,000.  
- **Affordable Home Budget**: ₹24,00,000 to ₹36,00,000 (2x–3x annual income).  

This ensures you don't overextend yourself financially and still have enough for other priorities (investments, emergencies, and day-to-day expenses).

### Key Considerations Before Buying a Home:  
1. **Hidden Costs**: Factor in registration fees, stamp duty, maintenance charges, and furnishing costs.  
2. **Investment Philosophy**:  
   - Avoid buying real estate too early if it will strain your savings or limit your ability to invest in higher-return assets like stocks.  
3. **Rent vs. Buy Analysis**: Consider renting if property prices are very high compared to rental costs in your city.
