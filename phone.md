When buying a phone, it’s best to stick to a budget that aligns with your income and financial goals. Here's a simple guide:

### **Budget Rule for Phones**  
1. **1–2% of Annual Income**: Financial advisors suggest spending no more than 1–2% of your annual income on a phone to avoid overspending.  
   - **Example**:  
     - Annual Income: ₹12,00,000.  
     - Recommended Budget: ₹12,000 to ₹24,000.

2. **Avoid EMI for Phones**: Since phones depreciate quickly, it’s better to buy them outright rather than paying EMIs with added interest.

### Tips for Choosing a Phone:  
1. **Evaluate Needs vs. Wants**:  
   - Basic use (calling, social media): Mid-range phones (₹15k–₹25k).  
   - Heavy use (gaming, photography): High-end phones (₹30k–₹70k).  

2. **Future-Proofing**:  
   - Look for at least 5G compatibility, regular software updates, and good hardware to avoid upgrading frequently.  

3. **Avoid Flagship Splurges**: Don’t overspend on ultra-premium phones unless you can afford the luxury comfortably.
