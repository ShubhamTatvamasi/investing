### Budget Rule:
- Spend **no more than 50% of your annual income** on a car if you want to stay financially comfortable.
- For example:
  - **Annual Income**: ₹12,00,000 (₹1,00,000/month).
  - 50% of ₹12,00,000 = ₹6,00,000.
  - You can afford a car worth ₹6 lakhs without straining your finances.

### Tips for Financial Safety:
1. **Emergency Funds First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before purchasing a car.
2. **Consider Hidden Costs**: Factor in additional costs like insurance, fuel, servicing, and registration fees.
